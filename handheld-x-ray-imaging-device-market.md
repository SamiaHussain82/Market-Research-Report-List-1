<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld X Ray Imaging Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DR</li><li>CR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld X-ray imaging device market is primarily divided into two types: Digital Radiography (DR) and Computed Radiography (CR). DR utilizes flat panel detectors to directly convert X-ray energy into digital images, offering real-time imaging with high quality and reduced radiation exposure. In contrast, CR employs phosphor plates to capture X-ray images, which are later scanned and digitized. While CR is typically more versatile and lower in initial cost, DR provides superior image clarity and faster processing, making it a preferred choice in many applications.</p></p>

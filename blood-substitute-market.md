<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Substitute Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HBOC</li><li>PFBOC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The blood substitute market primarily consists of two types: Hemoglobin-Based Oxygen Carriers (HBOC) and Perfluorocarbon-Based Oxygen Carriers (PFBOC). HBOCs are derived from hemoglobin and are designed to transport oxygen throughout the body, offering a potential alternative to donated blood. PFBOCs, made from perfluorocarbon compounds, can dissolve and transport oxygen and carbon dioxide, serving as another blood substitute option. Both types aim to address blood shortage issues and enhance oxygen delivery during medical treatments.</p></p>

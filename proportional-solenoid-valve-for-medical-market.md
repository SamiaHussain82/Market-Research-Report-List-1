<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Proportional Solenoid Valve for Medical Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Acting Proportional Solenoid Valve</li><li>Pilot Proportional Solenoid Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the medical market, proportional solenoid valves are essential for precise fluid control. Direct acting proportional solenoid valves operate directly on the fluid flow, allowing for immediate response and high precision in small-scale applications. Pilot proportional solenoid valves, on the other hand, utilize a smaller pilot valve to control larger flows, making them suitable for applications requiring higher pressure or flow capacities. Both types are important for devices such as infusion pumps, ventilators, and other medical equipment needing accurate fluid management.</p></p>
